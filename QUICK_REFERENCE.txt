TROUBLESHOOTING
───────────────

❌ "build.bat failed"
   → Install Python 3.12+ from python.org
   → Verify: python --version

❌ ".exe won't run"
   → Windows 10/11 only (64-bit required)
   → Check: 500 MB free space
   → Try: Run as Administrator

❌ "Port 5000 in use"
   → Close other applications using port 5000
   → Or edit launcher.py to use different port

❌ "Browser doesn't auto-open"
   → Manually open: http://localhost:5000
   → Or: Double-click frontend/pages/index.html

❌ "Always returns 0.5 score"
   → Stub models are in use (expected for demo)
   → Replace with real models for production

❌ "Antivirus blocks .exe"
   → Normal for bundled executables
   → Whitelist in antivirus settings
   → Code is safe (open-source, auditable)


DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOWS
───────────────────

WORKFLOW A: One-time Build + Distribute
  Developer:
    1. Run build.bat
    2. Get dist/CredibilityCheck.exe
    3. Upload to website / GitHub / email
  User:
    1. Download .exe
    2. Double-click
    3. App works (zero setup)

WORKFLOW B: Continuous Updates
  Developer:
    1. Make code changes
    2. Run build.bat
    3. Distribute new .exe
  User:
    1. Download new .exe
    2. Double-click
    3. Runs with updates

WORKFLOW C: Production Deployment
  1. Replace stub models with real trained models
  2. Add production API keys to backend/config/secrets.env
  3. Build: build.bat
  4. Test: dist/CredibilityCheck.exe
  5. Deploy: Share .exe + documentation


BUILD COMMAND
─────────────

First time (installs PyInstaller):
  .\build.bat          (5-10 minutes)

Subsequent times:
  .\build.bat          (3-5 minutes, dependencies cached)

Output:
  dist/CredibilityCheck.exe  (~300 MB)


SUCCESS CRITERIA
────────────────

✓ User downloads .exe
✓ User double-clicks
✓ App starts (5-10 sec)
✓ Browser opens automatically
✓ Frontend loads
✓ Can parse internship info
✓ Can get credibility scores
✓ No Python installation needed
✓ No setup or configuration
✓ Exits cleanly with Ctrl+C


IMPORTANT NOTES
───────────────

1. Windows-Only (Currently)
   This approach builds for Windows 10/11 (64-bit).
   For macOS/Linux: Create separate build.sh and build_mac.sh

2. Large File Size
   .exe is ~300 MB (includes Python runtime).
   This trades size for convenience (no pip install).

3. Update Model Logic
   To replace stub models with real ones:
   - Train Random Forest + Text CNN
   - Save to backend/models/saved/
   - Rebuild with build.bat
   - Distribute new .exe

4. Custom Configuration
   Edit launcher.py to:
   - Change port (line ~90)
   - Add logging
   - Auto-start on system boot
   - etc.

5. Source Code Included
   Users get full source code alongside .exe.
   Everything is transparent and auditable.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY FOR STAKEHOLDERS:

Problem:  "After download, users need to install Python, pip,
          create virtualenvs, install dependencies, etc."
          This is a 30+ minute setup process.

Solution: "PyInstaller bundles everything into a single .exe.
          Users download, double-click, and it runs.
          Zero setup required."

Result:   Download → Double-click → App works
          No Python knowledge needed.
          No manual setup.
          No dependency conflicts.
          No hidden assumptions.
